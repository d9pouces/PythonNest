Read-only Pypi mirror for disconnected networks, with advanced export / import functionnalities compared to other Pypi mirrors.
You should run two PythonNest instances:

   * the first one is connected to the internet and regularly fetch updates from the official mirror,
   * the second one is in your disconnected network.

The first instance export its data as plain files. Then these files can be sent to the second instance with a USB disk.

If you are looking for a mirror hosting your own private packages, you should look at `Moneta <http://moneta.readthedocs.org>`_.
